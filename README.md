# Ludusavi-extra-manifests
Extra manifests for [Ludusavi](https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi).

[**BS_ex-manifest.yaml**](https://github.com/BloodShed-Oni/ludusavi-extra-manifests/blob/main/BS_ex-manifest.yaml) contains game-save location data for games with (currently) no entry on [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com), or versions with incompatible save data from their originals (ex. source ports).

[**BS_software-manifest.yaml**](https://github.com/BloodShed-Oni/ludusavi-extra-manifests/blob/main/BS_software-manifest.yaml) kind of goes against the main purpose of Ludusavi, but expands the utility of it by adding location data for a selection of software configs (ex. TrenchBroom map editor).


## How to use
* Download manifest file(s) somewhere on your computer
* Open Ludusavi gui (type 'ludusavi' in Windows Run or command prompt).
* Press the 'Other' button.
* Under the 'Manifest:' section change the line from 'URL' to 'File'.
* Press folder button to navigate to and select the manifest file
* (Optional) press the '+' button to add a new line and repeat the 2 previous steps as needed.
