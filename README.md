# ludusavi-extra-manifests
Extra manifests for Ludusavi.

[**BS_ex-manifest.yaml**](https://github.com/BloodShed-Oni/ludusavi-extra-manifests/blob/main/BS_ex-manifest.yaml) contains game-save location data for games with (currently) no entry on [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com), or versions with incompatible save data from their originals (ex. source ports).

[**BS_software-manifest.yaml**](https://github.com/BloodShed-Oni/ludusavi-extra-manifests/blob/main/BS_software-manifest.yaml) kind of goes against, but expands the utility of Ludusavi by adding location data for a selection of software configs (ex. TrenchBroom map editor).
